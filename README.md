# GivenFilesystem

GivenFilesystem is a set of helpers for testing code which operates on file
systems. It lets you create temporary directories and files with given content as
test data. You can write to these directories and GivenFilesystem takes care of
cleaning up after the test. It only assumes that you can set the path to your
file system data in your tests.

GivenFilesystem provides helpers for RSpec and a standalone class.

## Usage with RSpec

### Setup

To use the GivenFilesystem helpers in a RSpec test you have to include the
`GivenFileSystemSpecHelpers` module to get access to the helper methods, and
set up the temporary test directory by calling `use_given_filesystem`:

```ruby
include GivenFileSystemSpecHelpers

describe "some test" do
  use_given_filesystem

  it "tests something" do
    ...
  end
end
```

The activation with `use_given_filesystem` gives you fine-grained control
about how the test directories are handled. It takes a parameter to keep the
created test files around:

```ruby
use_given_filesystem( :keep_files => true )
```

This can be useful when debugging tests.


### File fixtures

With GivenFilesystem you can create directories and files with pre-defined
content. These can be used as test fixtures for code reading from a file
system.

File fixtures, i.e. files containing test content, are stored in the
`spec/data/` directory. GivenFilesystem provides helper functions to create
temporary directories with defined structure and content using the file
fixtures. The file names can be taken directly from the name of the file
fixtures or be defined when creating the test directory structure.


### Creating directories

Create a temporary directory for writing test data:

```ruby
path = given_directory
```

Use the returned path to access the directory.

Create an empty temporary directory with a given name for writing test data:

```ruby
path = given_directory "myname"
```

Create a temporary directory with a given from data you provide in the
directory `spec/data` of your project:

```ruby
path = given_directory_from_data "myname"
```

This copies the directory `spec/data/myname` to a temporary test directory
and returns the path to the `myname` directory.

You can also create the directory under a different name:

```ruby
path = given_directory_from_data "myothername", :from => "myname"
```

This will copy the same data, but put it into a directory named `myothername`.


### Creating files

Create a temporary file with arbitrary content:

```ruby
path = given_dummy_file
```

Use the returned path to access the file.

Create a temporary file with given content take from a file fixture:

```ruby
path = given_file "myfixture"
```

The content of the file is taken from a file fixture stored in your `spec/data`
directory. The name of the created file is the same as the name of the file
containing the test content.

Create a temporary file with given content under a different name:

```ruby
path = given_file "myspecialfile", :from => "myfixture"
```

The content of the file is taken from the file `spec/data/myfixture` and stored
under the name `myspecialfile` in a temporary directory. You can access it under
the returned path.


### Creating structures of directories and files

You can combine `given_directory` and `given_file` to create file system
structures as input for you tests. Here is an example:

```ruby
path = given_directory "mydir" do
  given_directory "one" do
    given_file "myfile"
    given_file "myotherfile"
  end
  given_directory "two" do
    given_file "myfile2", :from => "myfile"
  end
end
```

This will create the following file system structure and return the path to the
temporary directory `mydir`, which you can then use in your tests to access the
data:

```
/tmp/
  given_filesystem/
    3845-20140216-74592/
      mydir/
        one/
          myfile
          myotherfile
        two/
          myfile2
```

### Using directory structures in name parameters

All directory or file name parameters can contain additional directory
structure. The required nested directories are automatically created. For
example the call

```ruby
  given_directory( "a/b/c" )
```

will create the following structure:

```
/tmp/
  given_filesystem/
    7373-2014-03-15-98223/
      a/
        b/
          c/
```

and return the path to the directory `a`.
